Table: SettingList
A dark forest full of traps and magical creatures
The seafloor
A derelict space station floating in orbit around a distant planet
An abandoned amusement park at night
The surface of an unknown planet, far away from Earth
The center of a massive mountain range where nobody has ever ventured
A massive library full of real, physical books that no one has ever read before
The very tip-top floor of a massive skyscraper
An isolated prison in the middle of an endless desert
The house at the end of a long, winding road leading to nowhere else but more road with no landmarks or distinguishing characteristics
A small farmhouse on a large plot of farmland, surrounded by woods and swamps on all sides
An abandoned warehouse filled with secret passageways that are impossible to find without help from someone who knows them by heart
The surface of Mars during sunrise over Olympus Mons Crater
On an elevated platform at the center of a small island
The very, very bottom floor of a massive skyscraper that has been abandoned since construction was completed
An underground cave system where one can go for days without seeing sunlight or another living being
A space shuttle orbiting around Jupiter
In the belly of a massive whale as it swims through dark, frigid waters filled with horrific monsters and other life forms from Earth's deepest nightmares.
On the surface of Venus during sunrise over Sif Mons Crater
In a massive library filled to the brim with books so old, they crumble to dust when touched by human hands, at least if their age is not protected by magic or advanced technology beyond what humanity understands today
A massive tree with a labyrinth of interconnected rooms and underground tunnels deep within its roots, filled with strange creatures like nothing ever seen on Earth before
The center of the sun
In the mouth of a massive dragon as it flies through the sky
On an abandoned oil platform in the middle of an ocean where strange sea creatures lurk, and unknowable horrors hide just out of sight under dark, stormy waters
Beneath the surface of Europa during sunrise over Valhalla Crater
A massive cave system that has been occupied by orcs for centuries upon centuries
An endless desert where sandstorms strike without warning and can carry entire structures away if they aren’t built properly to withstand the elements
A small, floating island somewhere in the Indian Ocean that is only accessible every seven years when the tides pull it closer to other islands and civilizations ashore
In a tent at a massive music festival miles away from civilization
Underground while being chased by trolls with weapons forged from precious metals and stones no human has ever seen before
On a far-off planet orbiting a distant star where friendly inhabitants will welcome you with open arms, but be careful about what you accept or take from them - the planetary economy might not be able to handle Earth's money supply
Inside Amazon forest
In a small town in the center of a large valley surrounded by dense forests and thick swamps
In a dark alley in New York City at night, desperately trying to find your way home from work before something bad happens
A small town that has been cut off from civilization for centuries upon centuries, isolated from humanity behind seemingly impenetrable walls built to keep out dangerous monsters that lurk outside the village’s limits
A small shuttlecraft piloted by an AI on its way to explore Pluto and beyond
In a massive city made of towers stacking high into the sky, each one attached to another by bridges and elevators that stretch from floor to floor
A single room in an apartment complex near a major city where strange noises and smells come from beneath the floorboards late at night
The depths of an ancient jungle filled with giant trees and nocturnal predators whose roars echo through the forest like nothing ever heard before on Earth
Atop a large mountain looking down upon a vast desert filled with sand dunes as far as the eye can see
On an abandoned oil platform in the middle of an ocean where strange sea creatures lurk, and unknowable horrors hide just out of sight under dark, stormy waters

A boarding school built on an alien planet
The edge of space broken by an enormous asteroid field and marked with craters and jagged ridges where stars have fallen to Earth (and beyond!)

An untamed wilderness filled with wild creatures and beasts of many kinds
A world where the sun is just a bright point in the sky, but there are entire civilizations out there that have completely abandoned their own star for another one entirely. There’s no way to travel between them without making a trip through an inter-dimensional rift or wormhole
A futuristic mega-city at night, full of glowing billboards advertising products that no one will ever buy (and there's a great deal more to discover!)

Ancient Underground Cities
On the set of a cheesy old science fiction movie from the 1960s
A lush jungle of tall, sprawling trees that are completely covered in thick vines and tangled undergrowth
A strange world where everything looks wrong (that’s how it always starts!)
A post-apocalyptic wasteland populated by desperate survivors scavenging for resources to survive another day. There are still pockets of civilization here and there, but they have fallen into chaos as the population has dwindled due to starvation or plague. The landscape is littered with debris from the former days, while the skies are a burning orange and red. The air is thick with ash and dust, making breathing difficult at best.
A mysterious technological planet filled with massive construction projects that seem to have no purpose whatsoever
An alien world full of colorful plants/animals (and other creatures) that somehow still manages to be boring as hell. There aren’t many places for settlers to set up shop, so it’s mostly just a large.
A beautiful world filled to the brim with dragons and other amazing creatures, but also completely devoid of life.
A peaceful world with lush fields, rolling hills, and deep forests where life is bright and cheery. The sky is always clear blue; there are no storms or hurricanes to be found.

A once proud civilization was reduced to ruins by an unknown enemy.
The cold vacuum of space, where nothing lives or grows

The inside of a massive haunted house or castle
The inside of a giant amusement park filled with all sorts of rides and attractions. Unfortunately, the park has been deserted for decades, so anything that can move is inoperable. The vast majority of people who went missing over the years were just sucked into this place when they happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
A peaceful village in the mountains where everything is quiet and calm. It’s all fun and games until someone shows up with a gun, demanding whatever valuables you might be hiding away. Once they get what they want, you’re either forced into servitude or simply executed on the spot (depending on how nice their boss happens to be feeling at the time)
The inside of a department store during the busiest shopping day of the year
A dark and dangerous world where mutants, robots, cyborgs, zombies, and other vile creatures are constantly trying to kill each other.
Inside the great pyramid of Giza
A massive cruise ship that has been stranded at sea
A futuristic manufacturing facility with
A city of the undead
A post-apocalyptic wasteland
A futuristic sports arena inside a mountain range
A great white wasteland covered entirely in snow and ice. The temperature is far too cold for any sort of human settlement.
A crowded coffee shop
An abandoned mansion
A field in springtime
An erupting volcano
The cockpit of an airplane during takeoff or landing in rough weather (I like this one. I’d go for the cockpit of a passenger airliner.)
A library at night
The first row at a rock concert
Mount Everest
Underwater (Like “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.”)
On top of a skyscraper during a thunderstorm at night (Like that part in Spiderman 3 where Spidey’s fighting the Lizard and what’s-his-name.)
